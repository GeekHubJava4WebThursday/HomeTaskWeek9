# Home Task Week 9

The main goal of this hometask is to create web file manager using Servet API and Files NIO
It must have an ability to display directory contents (subdirectories and files), view (if it's possible), create and remove files.

Several steps to do:

1. Checkout project from repository
2. Use IDEA to create project new from sources (just open newly created folder using IDEA)
3. Download latest [tomcat]{http://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi}
4. Create run configuration
    1. Open the Run/Debug Configurations dialog (e.g. Run | Edit Configurations).
    2. Click +, select Tomcat Server -> Local
    3. Click on "Configure" button and configure path to your tomcat server
    4. On Deployments add your war artifact (if it's not defined then IDEA will suggest you to fix it, click on "Fix" button and choose to create artifact from Module)
    5. Click OK
5. Implement unimplemented methods :)
